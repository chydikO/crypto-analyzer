A new Ukraine Defense Contact Group (Ramstein) meeting will take place offline from September 17 to 24, according to Minister of Defense of Ukraine Oleksii Reznikov.

The key issues at the Ramstein meeting will remain substantially unchanged. In particular, the top priority is strengthening Ukraine's air defense.

"More missiles, more systems, more radars, plus aviation as a component of air defense. The second issue is artillery and ammunition. The third thing is armored vehicles of all types," Reznikov emphasized.

Responding to the question of whether the role of Ramstein meetings has diminished, the minister stated, "No, we cannot say that categorically."
